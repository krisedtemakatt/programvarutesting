# V1:

Joars result differed from our answer key in 3 points for version 1.

1. Joar said that logging in does not behave the same every time because when you attempt a login after an error, you don't know if the error remains because of the previous attempt or because it's a new error. This was a fault of the answer key.
2. Joar did have safari because windows
3. Joar did not believe that it worked on a smartphone because it was outside of the view. It technically did work but he said that it didn't.

# V2:

1. Joar believed that logging in behaves the same way every time, and did not find the random failures that happen.
2. Joar wrongly assumed that the website would work on edge without testing because it seemed bothersome to test.
3. Joar wrongly assumed that the website would work on safari without testing because it seemed bothersome to test and he does not habve access to safari.
4. Joar wrongly assumed that the website would work on firefox without testing because it seemed bothersome to test.

# V3:

1. Joar mistakenly thought that logging in with valid username and valid password did not work, because he did not try
   all of the accounts to his disposal, and for V3 two of the accounts did not work.
2. Because the text was so small, Joar did not notice that it was visible to users who would zoom in.
3. Since Joar never managed to login at all, a lot of the functionality was mistakenly identified as not working.
4. Because Joar never managed to login (it worked on Admin), he assumed that it also wouldn't work on Edge, Safari, Firefox, Phone
