# V2

Functionality:

- Got different from answer-key in test 3(invalid password) and 9 (case sensitive). Interpreted 'credentials' as 'invalid password'.
- Said it was case sensitive, but it isn't

Reliability:

- Test subject's answer did not match our answer-key. They interpreted as the user can log in again in case of error AND that test behaves the same way the entire time. None of this is true and woul've needed more attempts from the subject

Usability:

- correctemento

Efficiency:

- correctemento

Portability:

- Didn't want to try portability

# V3

Functionality:

- Assumed that everything was incorrect becasue of the design and annoying tweaks, however this is not true: some functionality is still intact, that conclusion is annoying to reach and would have needed lots of patience from tester.

Reliability:

- Correct

Usability:

- correctemento, nothing looks good

Efficiency:

- correcte

Portability:

- Didn't want to try portability, didnt have the patience
